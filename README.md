# Design-of-a-Simple-CPU-in-Verilog
A Simple CPU that contains Latches, ALU, FSM, and decoder in Verilog, simulated using Vivado to perform various arithmetic and logical operations displaying results on 7-segment displays.

## Features
- **Mealy State Machine**: Handles control logic for the CPU's operation.
- **ALU**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Decoder**: Decodes FSM outputs into control signals.
- **Seven-Segment Display**: Displays results of operations and error states.
- Modular design with separate files for each major component.
